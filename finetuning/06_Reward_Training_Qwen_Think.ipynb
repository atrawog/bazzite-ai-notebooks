    "\n",
    "Tests Reward Model training with Unsloth on Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key features tested:**\n",
    "- AutoModelForSequenceClassification loading with 4-bit quantization\n",
    "- LoRA adapter configuration for reward modeling\n",
    "- RewardTrainer with preference pairs that score thinking quality\n",
    "- Post-training reward scoring verification\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reward Model Overview:**\n",
    "Reward models learn to score responses based on human preferences. They output a scalar reward for each response, used in RLHF pipelines (GRPO, RLOO) for policy optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thinking Preference:**\n",
    "- **Higher reward**: Responses with quality self-questioning `<think>` blocks\n",
    "- **Lower reward**: Responses with poor, minimal, or no thinking\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** This notebook includes a kernel shutdown cell at the end to release all GPU memory."
