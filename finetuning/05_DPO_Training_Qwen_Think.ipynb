    "\n",
    "Tests Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with Unsloth on Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key features tested:**\n",
    "- FastLanguageModel loading with 4-bit quantization\n",
    "- LoRA adapter configuration\n",
    "- DPOTrainer with preference pairs that reward thinking quality\n",
    "- Chosen responses include self-questioning `<think>` blocks\n",
    "- Rejected responses have poor/no thinking\n",
    "\n",
    "**DPO Overview:**\n",
    "DPO learns from preference pairs (chosen vs rejected responses) without an explicit reward model. It directly optimizes the policy using the Bradley-Terry preference model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thinking Preference:**\n",
    "- **Chosen**: Responses with quality self-questioning reasoning in `<think>` blocks\n",
    "- **Rejected**: Responses with poor, minimal, or no thinking\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** This notebook includes a kernel shutdown cell at the end to release all GPU memory."
