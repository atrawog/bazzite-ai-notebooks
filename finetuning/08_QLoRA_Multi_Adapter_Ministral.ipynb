    "\n",
    "Demonstrates training multiple task-specific LoRA adapters and switching between them at inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks/Adapters:**\n",
    "1. **Technical Q&A** - Precise technical explanations\n",
    "2. **Creative Writing** - Imaginative, expressive responses\n",
    "3. **Code Explanation** - Code-focused analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key features demonstrated:**\n",
    "- Training independent adapters on different datasets\n",
    "- Saving lightweight adapter weights (~33M params each)\n",
    "- Switching adapters at inference time\n",
    "- Same prompt → different responses per adapter\n",
    "- `[THINK]` reasoning capability preserved across all adapters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits of multi-adapter approach:**\n",
    "- Modular specialization without retraining base model\n",
    "- Hot-swap capabilities at runtime\n",
    "- Storage efficient (adapters are ~130MB each vs ~6GB base model)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model:** Ministral-3B-Reasoning with `[THINK]...[/THINK]` reasoning format\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Modularity**: Each adapter specializes in a specific task\n",
    "2. **Efficiency**: Adapters are ~130MB each vs ~6GB base model\n",
    "3. **Flexibility**: Hot-swap adapters at runtime\n",
    "4. **Preservation**: Base model capabilities remain intact\n",
    "\n",
    "### Response Style Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "| Adapter | Expected Style |\n",
    "|---------|---------------|\n",
    "| Technical | Precise, factual, structured |\n",
    "| Creative | Expressive, metaphorical, imaginative |\n",
    "| Code | Code-focused, syntax-aware, practical |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reasoning Preservation\n",
    "\n",
    "All adapters should maintain the `[THINK]...[/THINK]` reasoning pattern from the base Ministral-3B-Reasoning model, but the thinking content may reflect the adapter's specialization.\n",

    "# Load base model once\n",
    "base_model = load_model()\n",
