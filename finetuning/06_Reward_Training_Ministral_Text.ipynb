    "# Reward Model Training Test: Ministral (Text-Only)\n",
    "\n",
    "Tests Reward Model training with Ministral for use in RLHF pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Variant:** Text-only (AutoModelForSequenceClassification)\n",
    "**Expected Result:** NOT SUPPORTED - Ministral-3B is multimodal and doesn't support SequenceClassification\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reward Model Overview:**\n",
    "Reward models are trained to score responses, used as reward signals in RLHF training (PPO, RLOO). They require AutoModelForSequenceClassification architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Issue:**\n",
    "- `unsloth/Ministral-3-3B-Reasoning-2512` is a multimodal model (Mistral3ForConditionalGeneration)\n",
    "- AutoModelForSequenceClassification is not compatible with multimodal architectures\n",
    "- The model lacks a classification head required for reward scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternatives:**\n",
    "1. Use a pure text model (Mistral-7B, Qwen3-4B) for reward modeling\n",
    "2. Use GRPO with custom reward functions instead of trained reward models (see 04_GRPO_*.ipynb)\n",
    "3. Use generation-based reward proxies (response quality scoring via generation loss)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** This notebook documents the incompatibility rather than attempting training."
